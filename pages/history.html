                <p>St. Anthony’s Catholic Comprehensive Institute took its name from St. Anthony’s Teacher Training Collage Agulu. This Teacher Training Collage was cited by the Arch Bishop of Onitsha His Grace Most Rev. C. Henry in 1948. Rev. Fr. C. Liddan the famous parish priest and the manager of the old Adazi was architect behind the sitting of this Teacher’s Training Collage. He appointed Rev. Fr. Chamberlin as the first principal of the school.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Fr. Chamberlin assumed office in 1948 and admitted the first set of students. The second principal Rev. Fr. Halphis solidified the work of his predecessor from 1951-1956. In 1957 the third principal Rev. Fr. Edward Hurly replaced Rev. Fr. Halphis. However, during the tenure of Rev. Fr. Cockran as the 4th principal of the collage, the then Eastern Nigerian Regional Government abolished the collage in1965. This marked the end of the first stage of development of the present St. Anthony’s.</p>
                    <p>As matter of fact, St. Anthony’s Teacher Training Collage (TTC) Agulu contributed immensely to the development of Agulu town and it’s environ. It produced eminent personalities such as Late Arch. Bishop A.K Obiefuna, Prof Pita Ejiofor, top government officials, Lawyers and Educationist.
    On 28th December 1990, Agulu Catholic Central Council thought of establishing a new school that would nurture the youths in skill acquisition and academics. Thus, this date marked the beginning of the second stage of the history of this citadel of learning. Therefore, under the chairmanship of Sir Anthony Ukoh Akpulu, a task force for the implementation of this ideal contributed plan was set. The five man committee were Chief Charles Chike Odumma (co- ordinate) Rev. Fr. Ignatius Ukoh (spiritual director) Mr. Livinus Obiefuna (chairman) Mrs. G. Uchenabo and Mr. Cyprian Okafor .Their main achievement was the location of the perfect site for the school between Girl’s High School Agulu and Practising School Agulu which was enclosed with a wall . As providence would have it and the desire to maintain the great old image of St. Anthony, this part of land was carved out from some portion of land of the1948-1965, St. Anthony’s Teacher Training College (TTC) Agulu.</p>
                    <p>In view of this development, Agulu central council had their annual meeting in 1991 and appointed (12) dignitaries as the management board headed by Chief A.N. Ejeagwu as the chairman and Late Prof. Dora Akunyili as the secretary. The board members took over the responsibilities of the task force. Adverts were placed for the recruitment of staff, and after conducting interview, Ichie Ikwuka C. Osakwe was appointed as the first principal of St. Anthony’s Vocational Institute, Agulu. On 12th October 1992 classes were opened.</p>
                    <p>On 14th April 1993, the board of governors awarded a contract to M/S construction company Onitsha for the construction of a three (3) storey classroom block in the school. Msgr B. Fr. Mmoujekwu became the first manager of the school on 8th August 1993. Rev .Fr. Emmanuel Otiaba succeeded Fr. Muojekwu as manager with the approval of the board more subjects were added into the school curriculum. At this time the manager were not full time managers. It was agreed that one of the parish priests working in Agulu would be appointed as the manager of the school.</p>
                    <p>On 1st December 1995 Chief Charles Chike Odumma took over the administration of the institute from the foundation principal on 18th march 1996. Late Mr. Okpala Ignatius was appointed as the principal of the institute in 1996. The then Bishop of Awka diocese Late Most Rev. S. A. Okafor visited the school to lay the foundation stone of the classroom &laboratory complex. The state ministry of education approved the school and the first batch of students sat for junior school certificate examination on 25th June 1996. </p>
                    <p>The manager then, Msgr B. K. Nwazojie left the school and travel overseas for his sabbatical leave and Rev. Fr. Dr. Anthony Onyekwelu became his successor. Rev.  Fr. Dr. Jerry Okeke successes Rev. Fr. Dr. Anthony Onyekwelu. On 19th January, 1998 Sr. Mary Frances Theresa Obasi reported to the school as the new principal. The first batch of students for West African Examination Council (WAEC) began their examination on 4th May, and ended on 4th June 1996.</p>
                    <p>The school was officially handed over to late Chief Sir S. C. Onunkwo by Sr. Mary Frances Obasi on 4th January 1999. It is worthy of note that late Chief Sir S.C. Onunkwo has become the longest serving principal of this Institution. He served the school seven good years. During this period Rev. Fr. Dr. I. Onwuatuegwu become the manager of this great school. Mr. Obiozo A.O. took over the mantle of leadership from late Chief Sir S.C .Onwnkwo. Engr. Eze C.N. Assumed duty as the principal of the school on 17th July, 2007 and Rev. Fr. Colman Onuegbu became the first full time manager of the school. On 5th October, 2012, Rev. Fr. Colman Onuegbu left to resume duty at Msgr Maduka Memorial Collage Ekwulobia, and that paved way for Rev. Fr. Dr. Ugochuwu Ngana as the manager and the principal of the school till date. The bishop Most Rev. P. C. Ezeokafor this year October 2017 appointed Rev. Fr. Roland Victor Okoli as the assistant manager of this great Institute.</p>
                    <p>It is worthy to note that so many people have contributed greatly to the success of this citadel of learning. The school has had assistance of many seminarians who did their one year apostolic work and added character to this Institution. They include Rev. Fr. Augustine Uzodigwe (2003-2004). The school has enjoyed the services of many great teachers who gave their time when the school needed them most. It is good to note that our diocesan chancellor Rev. Fr. Dr. Francis Chidiume taught Mathematics and Physics from 2001-2003. We are grateful for all the great sacrifices people.</p>
                    <p>Today October 26th 2017 is a Day to recall the journey so far and appreciate the contributions of many great men and women to this school. The status of our Lord Jesus Christ was donated by Chief Mrs Josiah Offor Ugwuka (Oba 1 of Agulu) through Igwe I.E. Obodoakor (Igwe 111 of Agulu). The status of St. Anthony’s was donated by SS3 students 2015/2016 set. The 1948 old St. Anthony’s Teacher Training College mud building plastered with cement was demolished on July 2014. The new three (3) storey building construction started same month in order to prepare accommodation for the incoming SS2 students. This structure is today completed and blessed building by His Lordship Most Rev. P. C. Ezeokafor. Many philanthropists donated to the completion of the work.</p>
                    <p>These celebrated personalities, groups and parish contributed their own quota to the development of the academic building.</p>
